    Add method statement(), which returns the PPI statement containing
    the string element, or nothing if none.

    Add the rest of the PPI::Element location methods, to wit:
    column_number(), line_number(), logical_filename(),
    logical_line_number(), and visual_column_number().

    Support locations relative to containing document if specified to
    PPIx::QuoteLike->new(), or if the string is a PPI::Element.
    Specifically, add PPIx::QuoteLike->index_locations(),
    PPIx::QuoteLike->flush_locations(), and
    PPIx::QuoteLike::Token->location().

    Add ::Utils::is_ppi_quotelike_element() which returns true if the
    argument is a PPI::Element of interest to us.

    All objects now have a variables() method inherited from
    PPIx::QuoteLike::Token. This method returns nothing unless
    overridden. It was added to eliminate $elem->can( 'variables' )
    ad-hocery.

    Eliminate redirections in POD URL links

    Fix broken POD links, and add test to ensure they stay fixed.

    Prohibit interpolation inside \N{...}.

    Fix error message in eg/pqldump

    Allow PPIx::QuoteLike::Utils::__variables() to take a PPI::Element
    (rather than PPI::Node), PPIx::Regexp::Element, PPIx::QuoteLike, or
    PPIx::QuoteLike::Token.

    Add eg/variables

    Only standalone graphemes and non-characters allowed as delimiters
    starting with Perl 5.29.0.
    
    Non-ASCII delimiters started working in 5.8.3, so that is what
    perl_version_introduced() returns for them.

    Collateral with all this, accept word characters as delimiters, but
    only with at least one space between the operator and the expression
    -- that is, 'qq xyx' is OK, but 'qqxyx' is not.

  Fix problem handling nested brackets.

  Fix various corner cases, including such things as '${^O}', '${]}',
    and even '$${$_[0]}', which turned out to be '$$' followed by
    '$_[0]'.

  Also pulled the variable recognition out into a separate module in
    anticipation of it being used other places.

  Dumper message if arg does not parse

  Recognize "$^O" (e.g.) as interpolating $^O, not $^ followed by a
    literal "O".

  Require PPI, which was formerly optional. This is because I decided
    that the variables() method (which needs it) was one of the
    fundamental points of the module.

  Another attempt to make old Perls work. Version 0.002 assumed I could
    have other interpolations in a regex with (??{...}), but this turned
    out not to be the case if Perl was earlier than 5.18.0. This was
    actually a step in the wrong direction since (?-1) works back to
    5.10.0.

  Add PPIx::QuoteLike::Dumper, redo eg/pqldump to use it.

  Recognize postderef slice syntax. This is stuff like $x->@[0,2] (array
    slice) or $x->@{foo,bar} (hash slice).

  Add methods perl_version_introduced() and perl_version_removed(). As
    of this release, the former returns '5.000' unless '\F' or postfix
    dereferencing are detected, and the latter always returns undef.

0.002		2016-06-11	T. R. Wyant
  Eliminte blockers to running under Perl 5.6. The significant change
    was replacing (?-1) in a regular expression (introduced in 5.9.5)
    with (??{...}) (going back to Heaven knows when, and used in
    Regexp::Common back in 2003).

  Initial release to CPAN.
