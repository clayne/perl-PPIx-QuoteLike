  Support new() argument 'encoding'
    This includes determining the proper encoding for PPI, with the
    encoding argument being used as default if this can not be done.

  Better bracket stripping in ppi().
    The problem here was that it was incorrectly changing '@{$x[$i]}' to
    '@$x[$i]'. The intent was that the brackets only be stripped if they
    enclose a variable name (e.g. '@{main::var}').

  Stricter test for names of interpolated variables. The old code
    allowed any mix of [\w:]. This tripped over "$foo::$bar", in which
    the correct parse has interpolation '$foo', string '::', and
    interpolation '$bar', but the former code made this interpolations
    '$foo::' and '$bar'. The correct parse is verified by B::Deparse,
    which deparses "$foo::$bar" to "${foo}::$bar".

  Add method variables() to return interpolated variable names. The
    basic implementatino is on PPIx::QuoteLike::Token::Interpolation,
    and was prompted by things like "@{[ qx<foo $bar> ]}", which
    requires PPIx::QuoteLike to call itself recursively. There is a
    convenience version of variables() on PPIx::QuoteLike.

  Fix spelling of PPI::Token::QuoteLike::Backtick. Previous code had
    'BackTick'.

  Handle double sigils

  Fix PPIx::QuoteLike->schild() and ->children().
    These used to be aliased to child() and children() respectively, but
    probably should not be since non-significant tokens now exist.

0.000_003	2016-04-26	T. R. Wyant
  Correct spelling of PPI::Token::QuoteLike::Readline. The previous
    version had 'ReadLine'.

0.000_002	2016-04-26	T. R. Wyant
  Add PPI::Token::QuoteLike::ReadLine to the PPI classes supported. Also
    support the analogous string '<foo>'.

  Correct PPI generated by "${foo}".

  Add -variables to eg/pqldump
