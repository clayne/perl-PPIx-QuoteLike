    Fix test failures & warnings under older Perls (I hope)

    Perl 5.29.0 also prohibits unassigned code points while explicitly
    allowing non-characters (permanently unassigned code points) and
    illegal code points (above 0x10FFFF).

    I did not pick up on this the first time around. Sigh.

    Only standalone grapheme delimiters allowed starting w/ 5.29.0

    This actually means significantly expanding the delimiters allowed, and
    then having perl_version_removed() return '5.029' if the delimiter
    matches /\p{Mark}/. This code does not operate under Perl 5.6 because it
    can not compile the regular expression. Whether PPI will actually
    generate a token with such delimiters is unknown to me.

    Collateral with this, accept word characters as delimiters, but only
    with at least one space between the operator and the expression -- that
    is, 'qq xyx' is OK, but 'qqxyx' is not.

    Ditch 'use base' from inc/ files.
    
    This was only in inc/My/Module/Build.pm. It was replaced by a 'use'
    followed by assignment to @ISA.
    
    The lib/ files are untouched because, at least in theory, this module
    needs to co-exist with Perl::Critic.

    xt/author/minimum_perl.t now checks 'use x.xxx'

  Fix problem handling nested brackets.

  Fix various corner cases, including such things as '${^O}', '${]}',
    and even '$${$_[0]}', which turned out to be '$$' followed by
    '$_[0]'.

  Also pulled the variable recognition out into a separate module in
    anticipation of it being used other places.

  Dumper message if arg does not parse

  Recognize "$^O" (e.g.) as interpolating $^O, not $^ followed by a
    literal "O".

  Require PPI, which was formerly optional. This is because I decided
    that the variables() method (which needs it) was one of the
    fundamental points of the module.

  Another attempt to make old Perls work. Version 0.002 assumed I could
    have other interpolations in a regex with (??{...}), but this turned
    out not to be the case if Perl was earlier than 5.18.0. This was
    actually a step in the wrong direction since (?-1) works back to
    5.10.0.

  Add PPIx::QuoteLike::Dumper, redo eg/pqldump to use it.

  Recognize postderef slice syntax. This is stuff like $x->@[0,2] (array
    slice) or $x->@{foo,bar} (hash slice).

  Add methods perl_version_introduced() and perl_version_removed(). As
    of this release, the former returns '5.000' unless '\F' or postfix
    dereferencing are detected, and the latter always returns undef.

  Eliminte blockers to running under Perl 5.6. The significant change
    was replacing (?-1) in a regular expression (introduced in 5.9.5)
    with (??{...}) (going back to Heaven knows when, and used in
    Regexp::Common back in 2003).

0.001		2016-06-09	T. R. Wyant
  Initial release to CPAN.
