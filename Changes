  Stricter test for names of interpolated variables.  The old code
    allowed any mix of [\w:]. This tripped over "$foo::$bar", in which
    the correct parse has interpolation '$foo', string '::', and
    interpolation '$bar', but the former code made this interpolations
    '$foo::' and '$bar'. The correct parse is verified by B::Deparse,
    which deparses "$foo::$bar" to "${foo}::$bar".

  Add method variables() to return interpolated variable names. The
    basic implementatino is on PPIx::QuoteLike::Token::Interpolation,
    and was prompted by things like "@{[ qx<foo $bar> ]}", which
    requires PPIx::QuoteLike to call itself recursively. There is a
    convenience version of variables() on PPIx::QuoteLike.

  Fix spelling of PPI::Token::QuoteLike::Backtick. Previous code had
    'BackTick'.

  Handle double sigils

  Fix PPIx::QuoteLike->schild() and ->children().
    These used to be aliased to child() and children() respectively, but
    probably should not be since non-significant tokens now exist.

  Correct spelling of PPI::Token::QuoteLike::Readline. The previous
    version had 'ReadLine'.

0.000_002	2016-04-26	T. R. Wyant
  Add PPI::Token::QuoteLike::ReadLine to the PPI classes supported. Also
    support the analogous string '<foo>'.

  Correct PPI generated by "${foo}".

  Add -variables to eg/pqldump
