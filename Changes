  Recognize numeric variables (e.g. $0)

0.000_016	2016-05-29	T. R. Wyant
  Recognize "$@" as a use of variable $@.

0.000_015	2016-05-29	T. R. Wyant
  "@*" is not an interpolation. That is, it is the same as '@*' because
    there is no such punctuation variable as @*.

  Add -ppi to eg/pqldump. This option causes the PPI parse of any
      interpolations to be displayed.

0.000_014	2016-05-19	T. R. Wyant
  Have the ppi() method understand $${foo} as a dereference of $foo, not
    as element {foo} of %$.

  Correct handling of PPI::Token::HereDoc

0.000_012	2016-05-17	T. R. Wyant
  "@@" is not an interpolation. That is, it is the same as '@@' because
    there is no such punctuation variable as @@.

  Support new() argument 'encoding'
    This includes determining the proper encoding for PPI, with the
    encoding argument being used as default if this can not be done.

  Better bracket stripping in ppi().
    The problem here was that it was incorrectly changing '@{$x[$i]}' to
    '@$x[$i]'. The intent was that the brackets only be stripped if they
    enclose a variable name (e.g. '@{main::var}').

  Stricter test for names of interpolated variables. The old code
    allowed any mix of [\w:]. This tripped over "$foo::$bar", in which
    the correct parse has interpolation '$foo', string '::', and
    interpolation '$bar', but the former code made this interpolations
    '$foo::' and '$bar'. The correct parse is verified by B::Deparse,
    which deparses "$foo::$bar" to "${foo}::$bar".

0.000_005	2016-04-28	T. R. Wyant
  Add method variables() to return interpolated variable names. The
    basic implementatino is on PPIx::QuoteLike::Token::Interpolation,
    and was prompted by things like "@{[ qx<foo $bar> ]}", which
    requires PPIx::QuoteLike to call itself recursively. There is a
    convenience version of variables() on PPIx::QuoteLike.

0.000_004	2016-04-26	T. R. Wyant
  Fix spelling of PPI::Token::QuoteLike::Backtick. Previous code had
    'BackTick'.

  Handle double sigils

  Fix PPIx::QuoteLike->schild() and ->children().
    These used to be aliased to child() and children() respectively, but
    probably should not be since non-significant tokens now exist.

0.000_003	2016-04-26	T. R. Wyant
  Correct spelling of PPI::Token::QuoteLike::Readline. The previous
    version had 'ReadLine'.

0.000_002	2016-04-26	T. R. Wyant
  Add PPI::Token::QuoteLike::ReadLine to the PPI classes supported. Also
    support the analogous string '<foo>'.

  Correct PPI generated by "${foo}".

  Add -variables to eg/pqldump
