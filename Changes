  Require PPI, which was formerly optional. This is because I decided
    that the variables() method (which needs it) was one of the
    fundamental points of the module.

  Another attempt to make old Perls work. Version 0.002 assumed I could
    have other interpolations in a regex with (??{...}), but this turned
    out not to be the case if Perl was earlier than 5.18.0. This was
    actually a step in the wrong direction since (?-1) works back to
    5.10.0.

  Add PPIx::QuoteLike::Dumper, redo eg/pqldump to use it.

  Recognize postderef slice syntax. This is stuff like $x->@[0,2] (array
    slice) or $x->@{foo,bar} (hash slice).

  Add methods perl_version_introduced() and perl_version_removed(). As
    of this release, the former returns '5.000' unless '\F' or postfix
    dereferencing are detected, and the latter always returns undef.

  Eliminte blockers to running under Perl 5.6. The significant change
    was replacing (?-1) in a regular expression (introduced in 5.9.5)
    with (??{...}) (going back to Heaven knows when, and used in
    Regexp::Common back in 2003).

  Initial release to CPAN.
